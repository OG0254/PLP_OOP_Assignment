# 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates **Polymorphism** in Python OOP using different vehicle classes.  
Each vehicle implements the same method `move()` but behaves differently.

---

## 🏗️ Features
- **Car** → move() prints "Driving 🚗"
- **Plane** → move() prints "Flying ✈️"
- **Boat** → move() prints "Sailing 🚤"
- **Bicycle** → move() prints "Pedaling 🚴"

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Save the code into a file called `main2.py`.
2. Run it with:
   ```bash
   main2.py
   ```
3. You’ll see how the same method `move()` behaves differently for each vehicle.

---

## 🎯 OOP Concept Demonstrated
- **Polymorphism** → The same method name (`move`) behaves differently depending on the class.

---

## ✅ Example Output
```
Car: Driving 🚗
Plane: Flying ✈️
Boat: Sailing 🚤
Bicycle: Pedaling 🚴
```
